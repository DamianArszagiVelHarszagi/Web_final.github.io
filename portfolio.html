					>I started my journey in 2020 when COVID hit. With a lot of free time
					on my hands, I began watching YouTubers who did video editing. I
					instantly loved it, and my dad noticed. He gave me access to his Adobe
					Creative Cloud account. At first, I made Fortnite montages for myself
					and my friends. They weren't great, but I improved every month.<br />
					<br />
					About a year later, I met a friend who helped me get better. He also
					introduced me to Adobe After Effects. It was tough at first, but after
					a few months, I got the hang of it and started making animations and
					Fortnite montages. Then, I took a 1.5-year break due to burnout.
					<br />
					<br />
					Later, a friend introduced me to a football player looking for a video
					editor for his clips. I got paid to do something I loved. Over the
					years, I've made around 100 videos.
					<br />
					<br />
					When university started, I didn't have much time to edit anymore. But
					just before the second semester, I found this major that includes
					video editing and jumped at the chance to enroll.
